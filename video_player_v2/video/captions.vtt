<p>Now that we've looked at the architecture
of the internet, let's see how you might</p>

2
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.535
<p>connect your personal devices to
the internet inside your house.</p>

3
00:00:07.535 --> 00:00:11.270
<p>Well there are many ways to
connect to the internet, and</p>

4
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.960
<p>most often people connect wirelessly.</p>

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.940
<p>Let's look at an example of how
you can connect to the internet.</p>

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.370
<p>If you live in a city or a town,
you probably have a coaxial cable for</p>

7
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.880
<p>cable Internet, or a phone line if you
have DSL, running to the outside of</p>

<p>our house, that connects you to
the Internet Service Provider, or ISP.</p>

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.730
<p>If you live far out in the country,
you'll more likely have</p>

10
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.430
<p>a dish outside your house, connecting
you wirelessly to your closest ISP, or</p>

11
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.190
<p>you might also use the telephone system.</p>

12
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.300
<p>Whether a wire comes straight from
the ISP hookup outside your house, or</p>

<p>it travels over radio
waves from your roof,</p>

14
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.760
<p>the first stop a wire will make once
inside your house, is at your modem.</p>

15
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.780
<p>A modem is what connects the internet
to your network at home.</p>
